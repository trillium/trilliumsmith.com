I was recently having trouble getting my `wake up` phrase to work properly in Talon, so I decided to try a phrase I don't use often: `Wakey wakey`.

It works! And it makes me feel a little silly/giddy every time

```
# spiteless_knausj_talon/core/modes/to_wake_mode.talon
mode: sleep
-

wiki wiki | wakey wakey: speech.enable()
```

## What's with the | symbol and the wiki words

The symbol `|` in a talon command means `OR`, so if Talon hears `wiki wiki` or `wakey wakey` then it will run the `speech.enable()` command. Talon Voice does a very good job of recognizing fake words such as `wakey`, but it's also good practice to match what Talon might likely hear, or to pick something that's easier to say.

## Update 2025-09-18

Sometimes I'd still hit some misrecognitions by Talon Voice, I've since updated this command to:

```
mode: sleep
-

(wiki | wakey | wake) (wiki | wakey | wake): speech.enable()
```

Where each of the words in the parentheses can be used, so if the system hears `wake wake` or `wiki wake` or `wiki wiki` those will all wake up Talon.
